## 9.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 789da06: ### Changed

  - `@studnicky/fetch`'s `FetchClient.create()`, `TestDispatcher.create()`, and `UndiciDispatcher.create()` return the invoking subclass's own type instead of the base class. Each already constructed the subclass via `new this(...)`; the factory now types its `this` parameter and constructs through `Reflect.construct`, so `MySubclass.create(...)` types as `MySubclass` and a subclass member is readable without a cast. A runtime guard throws a `TypeError` naming the factory if construction ever yields an instance outside the requested subclass's prototype chain. Calling the base class's `create(...)` directly is unaffected.
  - `@studnicky/context`'s `Context.create()` and `@studnicky/throttle`'s `Throttle.create()` follow the same conversion. These were the last two factories in the workspace still declaring the base class as their return type.
  - Subclasses across `fetch`, `request-executor`, `context`, and `throttle` drop their `static override create()` declarations. Each hardcoded `new ConcreteClass(...)` to recover the subclass type from a base-typed factory — the per-subclass workaround this conversion makes redundant, and one a properly polymorphic `create()` can no longer be validly overridden by.

  `@studnicky/fetch`'s `DispatcherAgent.create()` and its browser counterpart are unchanged: they return a foreign type or throw, so they are not factories of their own class.

### Patch Changes

- 789da06: ### Fixed

  - `retry`'s `failed-requests-increment` and `total-retries-counted` stats specs assert the rejection with `assert.rejects` before reading stats, instead of parking every assertion inside an unchecked `.catch()` handler that silently skips if `execute()` resolves.
  - `logger`'s `global-floor-*` and `transport-floor-warn` specs assert the exact ordered list of surviving levels, not just a record count. `create-default`, `create-string-level`, and `create-numeric-level` attach a `MemoryTransport`-free observer and log boundary levels either side of the parsed floor to prove the default and parsed levels take effect.
  - `entity-store`'s `hooks-remove-many` spec asserts the exact `{event, id}` sequence removed, not just an event count.
  - `bounded-dispatcher`'s `dispatch-concurrency-bound` spec asserts the exact observed concurrency ceiling instead of an inclusive range that also accepts a stricter-than-configured mutex.
  - `context`'s `initialize-empty` scenario now initializes with a genuinely empty store, and the `initialize-scope` runner asserts the resulting key set against the fixture instead of hardcoding an unreachable branch.
  - `errors`' `timeout-no-dangling-timer` spec asserts the hook-timeout race's timer is cleared via a `clearTimeout` spy, instead of an observation window far shorter than the timer it claims is not left dangling.
  - `retry`'s hook-throw, hook-timeout, fsm, instantiation, backoff-strategy, and retry-support specs drop redundant fixture-literal-to-hardcoded-literal assertions that followed a real check, or replace them with an assertion against the actual thrown error's identity where one was in scope.

- 789da06: ### Fixed

  - Every `*.scenarios.json` import across the test suites carries the `with { type: 'json' }` import attribute `module: NodeNext` requires, clearing 221 `TS1543` diagnostics that `tsc -b` never surfaced because test files aren't part of any package's typechecked build — only `tsconfig.eslint.json` (used for ESLint's type-aware rules) sees them, and it consumes type information without reporting `TS` diagnostics on its own.
  - Tests that constructed a `protected`-constructor class directly with `new` now call the class's `this`-polymorphic static factory instead (`Subclass.create(...)`), clearing 78 `TS2674` diagnostics across `Clock`, `Channel`, `Coalesce`, `EntityStore`, `CircuitBreaker`, `EventBus`, `Mutex`, and `RealTimeScheduler` subclasses. The remaining 86 `TS2674` instances are left on `new` because no fitting factory exists for that call site: `StateMachine` is abstract with no static factory at all; `EffectInterpreter`, `InterpreterHistory`, `DeadLetterQueue`, `Signal`, `FetchClient`, and `ErrorClassifier`'s factories (where one exists) hardcode their own class rather than accepting `this`, so calling them on a subclass returns the base type instead of the subclass; and `Channel`/`Coalesce` subclasses that are themselves generic and expose subclass-only members lose that member's type through the factory's necessarily looser `TInstance` bound, so the direct constructor call is correct as written.

### Major Changes

- d5be000: ### Changed

  - `Context.create(options)` constructs contexts from the required name configuration.
  - `Context.initialize(initial?)` is the sole public context-scope construction path and returns `ContextScopeInterface`.
  - `@studnicky/context` is the sole public code entrypoint.

- d5be000: This release establishes one canonical public path across the fixed `@studnicky/*` package group. Consumers import package-owned behavior, errors, entities, and interfaces from the owning package root, construct stateful primitives through `Class.create(config)`, and invoke direct operation methods. Package code subpaths and parallel construction APIs are outside the public contract.

  Composition packages expose the ordering, failure, aggregation, or publication behavior they own. Dependency functionality stays with its declaring package and is imported directly from that package root. Collaborator accessors do not mirror scheduler, semaphore, cache, coalescer, fetch, retry, signal, timing, context, machine, or interpreter APIs. `BoundedDispatcher.getBus()` remains the functional access path for subscribing to and draining dispatcher-owned publications.

  Every JSON-Schema-expressible pure-data structure is a schema-derived type alias. Interfaces represent only runtime, callable, constructor, nominal, readonly-access, class-bearing, or other contracts that are not wholly schema-expressible. Pure data referenced by an interface is declared separately as a schema-derived named type. Declaration comments provide no exemptions, and `entitySuite` configures `@typescript-eslint/prefer-function-type` as `off` so callable interfaces receive one consistent verdict.

  Schema and validator declarations import dependency-owned symbols directly: `FromSchema` and `JSONSchema` from `json-schema-to-ts`, `ValidateFunction` from `ajv`, and `JSONSchema7Type` from `json-schema`. Each consuming package declares the dependency it uses; substrate packages do not proxy-export those declarations.

  `HookInvoker.invoke(hookName, fn)` enters synchronous hooks and returns `undefined`. `HookInvoker.invokeAsync(hookName, fn)` observes completion and returns `Promise<void>`. `onHookError(hookName, cause)` controls failure disposition without fabricating a recovery value, while hook timeout and reentrancy failures retain their package error identities.

  FSM and process orchestration use one optional `EffectHandlerInterface<TEffect, TEvent>` handler. `EffectInterpreter`, `InterpreterHistory`, and `ProcessKit` accept it through their direct `create(config)` paths. `InterpreterHistory` retains bounded, oldest-first variant-changing transition records and returns isolated readonly snapshots.

  `Signal.create()` supplies instance `compose(options)` and `timeout(ms)` lifecycle behavior; `Signal.never()` supplies the static never-aborting sentinel. `Delay.sleep(ms, { clock?, scheduler?, signal? })` and `Delay.value(...)` share the scheduler-aware cancellation path.

  `Throttle.create(config)` validates and copies caller configuration into instance-owned state. Adaptive concurrency changes only the instance's effective limit. `getStats()` returns `ThrottleStatsEntity.Type`, and `ThrottleStatsEntity.validate` is the root-exported compiled validator for trust-boundary checks.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- `Context` provides per-request async isolation via `AsyncLocalStorage`; `get` returns `unknown` for runtime narrowing and `tryGet` returns a presence-aware `{ found, value }` result.
- `ContextScope` FSM (`created → active → terminated`) returned from `Context.initialize()`, with `execute()` for store-bound execution and `terminate()` to extract final state.
- Protected extension hooks on `Context` support initialization, missing-context handling, and store operation observability.
- Direct `Context.create({ name })` construction with an overridable `validateBuild` hook.
