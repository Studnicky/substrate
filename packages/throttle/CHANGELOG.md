## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- `Throttle` class with configurable `concurrencyLimit` (default 10) and sliding window execution — queued operations start as soon as a slot is released.
- `execute<T>(fn)` returns `Promise<T | undefined>`; operations resolve with `undefined` when the throttle is aborted (detach-and-abandon pattern).
- `abort(options?)` cancels all queued and active operations immediately (or after a grace-period timeout), returning `AbortResultInterface` with cancelled, completed, and timedOut counts.
- Optional adaptive concurrency via `AdaptiveConfigInterface` — automatically scales the concurrency limit up or down based on observed p95 latency.
