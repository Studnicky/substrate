## 9.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 789da06: ### Changed

  - `@studnicky/logger`'s `Logger.create()`, `ConsoleTransport.create()`, `MemoryTransport.create()`, `NoOpTransport.create()`, and `FunctionTransport.create()` return the invoking subclass's own type instead of the base class. Each already constructed the subclass at runtime via `new this(...)`; the factory now types its `this` parameter and constructs through `Reflect.construct`, so `MySubclass.create(...)` types as `MySubclass` and a subclass member is readable without a cast. A runtime guard throws a `TypeError` naming the factory if construction ever yields an instance outside the requested subclass's prototype chain. Calling `Base.create(...)` directly is unaffected — it still types as `Base`.
  - `@studnicky/clock`'s `Clock.create()`, `RealTimeClockProvider.create()`, `VirtualClockProvider.create()`, and `VirtualTimeCounter.create()` follow the same subclass-return pattern.
  - `@studnicky/timing`'s `Timing.create()` and `NoOpTiming.create()` follow the same subclass-return pattern.

### Patch Changes

- 789da06: ### Fixed

  - `Clock`, `RealTimeClockProvider`, `VirtualClockProvider`, `VirtualTimeCounter`, `MemoryTransport`, `NoOpTransport`, and `NoOpTiming` each carry their class documentation on the class again. The module-local `…SubclassInterface` and `…Instance` helpers their factories rely on sat between the doc comment and the class it describes, so the generated API reference attributed each class's summary and usage example to a non-exported helper interface and left the exported class undocumented. The helpers now precede the doc comment.

- 789da06: ### Fixed

  - `logger`'s `Logger.scenarios.json` suite and `Logger.loop.spec.ts` drop the `expected.asserted: true` tautology from every case — each case's preceding behavioral assertions already prove the scenario. `LogEventName`'s `component-prefixes` case drops the redundant self-comparison of `input.components` against `expected.components` (and now also asserts `EVENT_COMPONENTS.TIMING`, the one component prefix the case previously left unchecked). `LogStatus.scenarios.json` drops the `input.values` field, which duplicated `expected.values` and was never read by the spec.
  - `circular-buffer`'s `CircularBuffer.scenarios.json` drops `shift-never-pushed-returns-undefined`, a verbatim duplicate of `shift-empty-returns-undefined`. `CircularBuffer.subclass.scenarios.json`'s `onEvict-called-with-evicted-item` now drives a longer five-push eviction chain distinct from `create-returns-subclass`, proving FIFO eviction order across three evictions instead of duplicating the same single-eviction fixture.
  - `fsm`'s `plain-error-wraps` scenario now throws a non-`Error` primitive from the reducer and asserts the resulting `ReducerThrewError`'s `cause` and the hook-observed `reason` string, exercising `StateMachine`'s `String(cause)` fallback — previously indistinguishable from `wraps-reducer-throw`, which throws a real `Error` and only exercised the `cause.message` branch.
  - `file-lock`'s `entities.scenarios.json` adds coverage for `FileLockOptionsEntity`'s previously-unexercised rejection branches: empty `path`, non-positive `pollMs`/`timeoutMs`, and an unexpected extra property under `additionalProperties: false`.
  - `timing`'s `immediate-operations` spec drops its upper-bound assertions (`durationMs < 5`, event elapsed `< 5`) taken from two back-to-back `process.hrtime()` reads with no busy-wait spacer — the fragile direction under load. It now asserts non-negativity only, matching every sibling case's lower-bound-only pattern.
  - `scheduler`'s `chained-timeout-fire` and `chained-timeout-cancel` specs no longer arm real `setTimeout` stages against a fixed wall-clock buffer. They drive `RealTimeScheduler`'s multi-stage chain deterministically via `node:test`'s `mock.timers` (mocking `Date` and `setTimeout`), ticking virtual time forward one `maxTimeoutDelayMs` stage at a time and cancelling mid-chain, eliminating the wall-clock margin entirely rather than widening it.

- 789da06: ### Fixed

  - `logger`'s `logger-primitive-contracts.loop.spec.ts`, `LogEventName.loop.spec.ts`, `LogStatus.loop.spec.ts`, and `Logger.loop.spec.ts` type their scenario runner maps with the `Extract<ScenarioCase, { shape: K }>`-keyed generic form instead of a flat `Record<ScenarioCase['shape'], (c: ScenarioCase) => void>`, so each runner narrows to its own case fields instead of the full union. `LogFault`'s scenario fixture input is split into a fully-optional variant for the deliberately-incomplete `log-fault-missing-field` case and a required-field variant for the three complete fault fixtures, matching what `LogFault.create()` actually requires. `LogEventName.scenarios.json` and `LogStatus.scenarios.json`'s cases gain the `name` field on their `ScenarioCase` type. `observedLogger.ts`'s `ObservedLogger.events` getter returns `readonly LogEventInterface[]`, matching `EventRecorder`'s readonly accessor.
  - `health-registry`'s `HealthRegistry.loop.spec.ts` and `HealthRegistryHooks.loop.spec.ts` adopt the same `Extract`-keyed runner map pattern. `HealthRegistryHooks.scenarios.json`'s `on-aggregate-after-settle` case's `ScenarioCase` type is corrected to `aggregateCountAfterFirst`/`aggregateCountAfterSecond`, matching the fixture and the assertions that already read those fields. `observedHealthRegistry.ts`'s inline health checks are `async`, matching `HealthCheckInterface`'s `Promise`-returning contract.
  - `request-executor`'s `request-executor.loop.spec.ts` adopts the same `Extract`-keyed runner map pattern, drops an unresolvable `RequestInfo` type reference in favor of contextual inference from `typeof fetch`, guards `RequestInit.signal` against `null` alongside `undefined`, and constructs `TrackingFetchClient` through its own `static create()` instead of `new` against `FetchClient`'s protected constructor.
  - `worker-pool`'s `creation.loop.spec.ts`, `hooks.loop.spec.ts`, `run.loop.spec.ts`, `termination.loop.spec.ts`, and `timeout.loop.spec.ts` adopt the same `Extract`-keyed runner map pattern. Local `Signal` and `WorkerPool` test subclasses that relied on the inherited `protected` constructor now declare their own `public constructor()`. `timeout.loop.spec.ts`'s `AbortedSignal` overrides `compose()` at its declared public visibility instead of narrowing it to `protected`. `pooling.loop.spec.ts` and `run.loop.spec.ts` assert `workerPool.concurrency` is defined before comparing against it, and `run.loop.spec.ts`'s `resolvePoolConfig` only sets `concurrency` on the resolved config when the input provides one, avoiding an explicit `undefined` under `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`.

- 789da06: ### Fixed

  - `retry`'s `failed-requests-increment` and `total-retries-counted` stats specs assert the rejection with `assert.rejects` before reading stats, instead of parking every assertion inside an unchecked `.catch()` handler that silently skips if `execute()` resolves.
  - `logger`'s `global-floor-*` and `transport-floor-warn` specs assert the exact ordered list of surviving levels, not just a record count. `create-default`, `create-string-level`, and `create-numeric-level` attach a `MemoryTransport`-free observer and log boundary levels either side of the parsed floor to prove the default and parsed levels take effect.
  - `entity-store`'s `hooks-remove-many` spec asserts the exact `{event, id}` sequence removed, not just an event count.
  - `bounded-dispatcher`'s `dispatch-concurrency-bound` spec asserts the exact observed concurrency ceiling instead of an inclusive range that also accepts a stricter-than-configured mutex.
  - `context`'s `initialize-empty` scenario now initializes with a genuinely empty store, and the `initialize-scope` runner asserts the resulting key set against the fixture instead of hardcoding an unreachable branch.
  - `errors`' `timeout-no-dangling-timer` spec asserts the hook-timeout race's timer is cleared via a `clearTimeout` spy, instead of an observation window far shorter than the timer it claims is not left dangling.
  - `retry`'s hook-throw, hook-timeout, fsm, instantiation, backoff-strategy, and retry-support specs drop redundant fixture-literal-to-hardcoded-literal assertions that followed a real check, or replace them with an assertion against the actual thrown error's identity where one was in scope.

- 789da06: ### Fixed

  - Every `*.scenarios.json` import across the test suites carries the `with { type: 'json' }` import attribute `module: NodeNext` requires, clearing 221 `TS1543` diagnostics that `tsc -b` never surfaced because test files aren't part of any package's typechecked build — only `tsconfig.eslint.json` (used for ESLint's type-aware rules) sees them, and it consumes type information without reporting `TS` diagnostics on its own.
  - Tests that constructed a `protected`-constructor class directly with `new` now call the class's `this`-polymorphic static factory instead (`Subclass.create(...)`), clearing 78 `TS2674` diagnostics across `Clock`, `Channel`, `Coalesce`, `EntityStore`, `CircuitBreaker`, `EventBus`, `Mutex`, and `RealTimeScheduler` subclasses. The remaining 86 `TS2674` instances are left on `new` because no fitting factory exists for that call site: `StateMachine` is abstract with no static factory at all; `EffectInterpreter`, `InterpreterHistory`, `DeadLetterQueue`, `Signal`, `FetchClient`, and `ErrorClassifier`'s factories (where one exists) hardcode their own class rather than accepting `this`, so calling them on a subclass returns the base type instead of the subclass; and `Channel`/`Coalesce` subclasses that are themselves generic and expose subclass-only members lose that member's type through the factory's necessarily looser `TInstance` bound, so the direct constructor call is correct as written.

## 9.0.0

### Major Changes

- d5be000: The package root is the sole code entrypoint for logger classes, transports, entities, constants, errors, and contracts.

  Serializable logger data is exposed through `LogRecordEntity.Type`, `LogBodyDataEntity.Type`, `LogFaultDataEntity.Type`, `LogLevelEntity.Type`, and `LogStatusEntity.Type`.

  Entity declarations import `JSONSchema` and `FromSchema` directly from `json-schema-to-ts`, and validator declarations import `ValidateFunction` directly from `ajv`.

  Logger, transport, and log-entry construction uses each class's direct `create()` entry point.

- d5be000: This release establishes one canonical public path across the fixed `@studnicky/*` package group. Consumers import package-owned behavior, errors, entities, and interfaces from the owning package root, construct stateful primitives through `Class.create(config)`, and invoke direct operation methods. Package code subpaths and parallel construction APIs are outside the public contract.

  Composition packages expose the ordering, failure, aggregation, or publication behavior they own. Dependency functionality stays with its declaring package and is imported directly from that package root. Collaborator accessors do not mirror scheduler, semaphore, cache, coalescer, fetch, retry, signal, timing, context, machine, or interpreter APIs. `BoundedDispatcher.getBus()` remains the functional access path for subscribing to and draining dispatcher-owned publications.

  Every JSON-Schema-expressible pure-data structure is a schema-derived type alias. Interfaces represent only runtime, callable, constructor, nominal, readonly-access, class-bearing, or other contracts that are not wholly schema-expressible. Pure data referenced by an interface is declared separately as a schema-derived named type. Declaration comments provide no exemptions, and `entitySuite` configures `@typescript-eslint/prefer-function-type` as `off` so callable interfaces receive one consistent verdict.

  Schema and validator declarations import dependency-owned symbols directly: `FromSchema` and `JSONSchema` from `json-schema-to-ts`, `ValidateFunction` from `ajv`, and `JSONSchema7Type` from `json-schema`. Each consuming package declares the dependency it uses; substrate packages do not proxy-export those declarations.

  `HookInvoker.invoke(hookName, fn)` enters synchronous hooks and returns `undefined`. `HookInvoker.invokeAsync(hookName, fn)` observes completion and returns `Promise<void>`. `onHookError(hookName, cause)` controls failure disposition without fabricating a recovery value, while hook timeout and reentrancy failures retain their package error identities.

  FSM and process orchestration use one optional `EffectHandlerInterface<TEffect, TEvent>` handler. `EffectInterpreter`, `InterpreterHistory`, and `ProcessKit` accept it through their direct `create(config)` paths. `InterpreterHistory` retains bounded, oldest-first variant-changing transition records and returns isolated readonly snapshots.

  `Signal.create()` supplies instance `compose(options)` and `timeout(ms)` lifecycle behavior; `Signal.never()` supplies the static never-aborting sentinel. `Delay.sleep(ms, { clock?, scheduler?, signal? })` and `Delay.value(...)` share the scheduler-aware cancellation path.

  `Throttle.create(config)` validates and copies caller configuration into instance-owned state. Adaptive concurrency changes only the instance's effective limit. `getStats()` returns `ThrottleStatsEntity.Type`, and `ThrottleStatsEntity.validate` is the root-exported compiled validator for trust-boundary checks.

- d51e400: ### Changed

  - `@studnicky/logger` exports `LoggerHookEventShapeEntity`. It replaces `LoggerHookEventKindEntity`; the entity's members and validator are unchanged.
  - `@studnicky/virtual-fs` `EntryEntity.Type` names its variant discriminant `shape`. It replaces `kind` and carries the same `'directory' | 'file'` values. `VirtualFileSystem.statSync()` results and every `EntryEntity` literal read or written by a consumer use the new field name.

### Major Changes

- 837480d: The package root is the sole code entrypoint for logger classes, transports, entities, constants, errors, and contracts.

  Serializable logger data is exposed through `LogRecordEntity.Type`, `LogBodyDataEntity.Type`, `LogFaultDataEntity.Type`, `LogLevelEntity.Type`, and `LogStatusEntity.Type`.

## 7.0.0

### Minor Changes

- d2b44b7: `@studnicky/types` exports `PickDefined.from(record)`, which strips `undefined`-valued keys from a record while narrowing each remaining value's type away from `undefined` — built for builders assembling an options object from a mix of required and optional fields.

  `@studnicky/errors` exports `DomainErrorArgs.build(fields, options)`, which computes `code`, `message`, `retryable`, `cause`, `correlationId`, and `metadata` for a `super()` call while preserving the leaf error's `extends` chain and `instanceof` behavior.

  `@studnicky/logger` exports `ResolveMinLevel.from(options)` for the level validation and resolution shared by built-in and third-party `TransportInterface` implementations.

- d2b44b7: `@studnicky/errors` exports `HookInvoker`, a composable delegate for safely invoking synchronous or asynchronous consumer lifecycle hooks without forcing asynchronous behavior on a synchronous caller or producing an unhandled rejection. A class composes it as a field and calls `invoke(hookName, fn)` from its own methods. The package also exports `HookInvocationError`, `HookTimeoutError` for a configured timeout, and `ReentrantHookInvocationError` for synchronous same-call-stack reentrancy.

  `@studnicky/entity-store`, `@studnicky/file-lock`, `@studnicky/health-registry`, and `@studnicky/worker-pool` route lifecycle hooks through a record-and-continue `HookInvoker` boundary. Failures are available through `hookErrorCount` and `getHookErrors()` (`getHookErrorCount()` and `getHookErrors()` on `WorkerPool`).

  `@studnicky/logger`'s `Logger` composes a plain `HookInvoker` for `onLog`, `onDropped`, and `onChildCreate`, and separately guards `onTransportError`. Transport-hook failures are available through `hookErrorCount` and `getHookErrors()`.

  `@studnicky/retry` and `@studnicky/pipeline` expose a `hookTimeoutMs` builder option and matching `Retry.create` and `Pipeline.create` configuration field. A configured timeout routes an unsettled lifecycle hook to `onHookError` with a `HookTimeoutError` cause; an omitted timeout remains unbounded.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- Exported log-level constants use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`: `LOG_LEVEL` and `LOG_LEVEL_MAP`.

### Changed

- `Logger`, `ConsoleTransport`, `MemoryTransport`, `FunctionTransport`, and `NoOpTransport` expose `Class.create(options)` and `Class.builder().build()` construction paths backed by protected constructors.
- `LogBody` and `LogFault` expose subclass-safe `static create()` construction.
- `BaseLogEntryBuilder` provides the protected constructor used by concrete subclasses.
- `LoggerBuilder`, `ConsoleTransportBuilder`, `MemoryTransportBuilder`, `FunctionTransportBuilder`, and `NoOpTransportBuilder` are exported from the package root and transport barrel where applicable.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- `Logger` core with pluggable `TransportInterface` port; a Logger with no transports is a valid silent logger
- `ConsoleTransport` — writes to console using a level-dispatch map; the only file permitted to use `console`
- `NoOpTransport` — discards all records.
- `MemoryTransport` — captures `LogRecordEntity.Type` records into an internal buffer; exposes `records()` and `clear()` for test assertion.
- `FunctionTransport` — generic bridge adapter; passes each record to a user-supplied sink function, enabling integration with pino, winston, or any external logger
- Per-transport level filtering: each transport accepts an optional `level` option that acts as an independent floor above the Logger global floor
- `LogRecordEntity.Type` — schema-derived record assembled at emit time, carrying `level`, `time` (milliseconds), `metadata`, and `data`.
- `LoggerOptionsEntity` namespace — `Schema`, `Type`, and `validate` type guard for Logger configuration
- `./transports` package export entry for direct transport imports
- Fluent `LogBody` and `LogFault` builders enforce all required fields at build time.
- Child loggers via `.child(metadata)` for correlation ID injection from async context
