/**
 * FSM state union for a single `Retry.execute()` call.
 *
 * Each call through execute() receives its own FSM instance so concurrent
 * executions do not share mutable state.
 *
 * Legal edges:
 * - attempting → succeeded   (fn resolved)
 * - attempting → waiting     (retryable error, budget remains)
 * - attempting → failed      (non-retryable error)
 * - waiting   → attempting   (delay elapsed, next attempt begins)
 * - waiting   → exhausted    (max retries reached while waiting to retry)
 * - waiting   → aborted      (lifecycle hook signalled abort)
 * - succeeded, failed, exhausted, aborted are terminals (no outbound edges)
