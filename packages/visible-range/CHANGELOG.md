## 9.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 789da06: ### Changed

  - `@studnicky/visible-range`'s `VisibleRange.create()`, `@studnicky/virtual-fs`'s `VirtualFileSystem.create()`, `@studnicky/sliding-window-limiter`'s `SlidingWindowLimiter.create()`, `@studnicky/sample-buffer`'s `SampleBuffer.create()`, `@studnicky/retry`'s `Retry.create()`, `@studnicky/batch`'s `Batch.create()`, `@studnicky/cache`'s `LruCache.create()`, `@studnicky/boundary-kit`'s `BoundaryKit.create()`, `@studnicky/entity-store`'s `EntityStore.create()`, `@studnicky/idempotency-guard`'s `IdempotencyGuard.create()`, `@studnicky/mutex`'s `Mutex.create()`, `@studnicky/keyed-work-gate`'s `KeyedWorkGate.create()`, and `@studnicky/bounded-dispatcher`'s `BoundedDispatcher.create()` return the invoking subclass's own type instead of the base class. Each already constructed the subclass at runtime via `new this(...)`; the factory now types its `this` parameter and constructs through `Reflect.construct`, so `MySubclass.create(...)` types as `MySubclass` and a subclass member is readable without a cast. A runtime guard throws a `TypeError` naming the factory if construction ever yields an instance outside the requested subclass's prototype chain. Calling `Base.create(...)` directly is unaffected — it still types as `Base`.
  - `@studnicky/keyed-rate-limiter`'s `KeyedRateLimiter.create()` follows the same subclass-return pattern across all three overloads (the default `TokenBucket` configuration signature, the generic strategy signature, and the implementation signature). Its `keyed-rate-limiter.loop.spec.ts` suite drops the five `as TrackingLimiter`/`as TrackingEvictionLimiter`/`as ThrowingEvictedLimiter` return-type casts that existed only because the factory wasn't polymorphic.

### Patch Changes

- 789da06: ### Changed

  - `@studnicky/clock`'s `Clock.scenarios.json` suite derives `long-uptime-precision`'s expected nanosecond value independently of `RealTimeClockProvider.hrtime()`'s internal trunc/multiply/round split, asserts both bounds around `Date.now()` for `real-provider-default-options`, reads the `offsetMs` getter from a subclass in `offset-provider-offset`, and asserts the actual offset-to-nanosecond relationship (rather than bare positivity) in `real-hrtime-positive-with-offset`/`-zero-offset`. Its smoke suite drops a tautological assertion that compared a fixture field to a hardcoded literal ahead of the real import check.
  - `@studnicky/types`' `Guard.asNumber` scenarios cover the NaN-passthrough asymmetry with `Guard.isNumber` (which excludes NaN). Its smoke suite drops the same tautological assertion.
  - `@studnicky/config`'s `Guard.isObject` scenarios cover `Map` and `Set` inputs, matching the documented plain-object exclusion. Its smoke suite drops the same tautological assertion.
  - `@studnicky/signal`'s `Signal.scenarios.json` suite drops four tautological assertions that compared a fixture field to itself ahead of the real behavioral check.
  - `@studnicky/boundary-kit`'s `undefined-result-vs-abort` scenario drops a tautological assertion ahead of the real result check.
  - `@studnicky/process-kit`'s `rejection` scenario asserts the thrown error's `constructor.name` from within the actual `assert.rejects` callback instead of comparing a fixture field to a hardcoded literal afterward.
  - `@studnicky/visible-range`'s `config-validation` `error-args` scenario asserts the constructed error's `cause`, `correlationId`, `metadata`, and `retryable` properties, matching its "structured error metadata" description. `visible-range.scenarios.json`'s `default-overscan` case now exercises a distinct count/itemSize combination instead of duplicating `simple-range` verbatim.
  - `@studnicky/memoize`'s `memoize-ttl-stale-options` scenario mocks `Date.now()` to advance past the configured `ttlMs`, proving the option reaches the underlying `LruCache` (an unwired option would keep replaying the first computed value indefinitely).

- 789da06: `SampleBufferError`, `BatchError`, `VirtualFileSystemError`, `CircularBufferError`, and `VisibleRangeError` honour a supplied `retryable` construction argument instead of discarding it, defaulting to `false` when omitted. Each declares `retryable` on its args interface, so a caller-supplied value now reaches `BaseError` and is readable as `error.retryable`.
- 789da06: ### Changed

  - `v8/inline-arrow-functions` and `v8/inline-functions` no longer exempt a dispatch-map property by its key name (`callback`, `execute`, `handler`, `message`, `process`, `transform`, `transformAsync`, `validate`). Whether an inline arrow or function value is flagged depends only on whether the enclosing object literal is rebuilt on every call — a module-scope `const` or `static` class field is still exempt, a map rebuilt inside a function body is still flagged, regardless of what its properties are named.
  - `descriptive-identifiers` no longer whitelists acronyms or loop-iterator names. Whether an identifier is flagged depends only on whether one of its camelCase tokens matches a banned shortening; single-letter loop iterators and short acronyms already fall outside that check structurally, since they never match a banned-shortening token.
  - `folder-content-shape` no longer exempts a file from the constants-placement or inline-regex checks by path (`constants/`, `fixtures/`, `tests/`, the `eslint-config` package, `eslint.config.mjs`, `entities/`, or an `index.ts` basename) or by declared name (`ajv`, `compiledValidator`, `Schema`, `validate`). A file is exempt only when it is structurally one of: a pure constants module (every top-level declaration is an import, a type declaration, or a data `const`), a module exporting an `*Entity`-named namespace, or a pure re-export barrel. Renaming a directory, moving a file into `constants/`, or naming a declaration `Schema`/`validate`/`ajv` no longer buys an escape on its own.

  ### Fixed

  - Thirteen domain error classes (`VisibleRangeError`, `VirtualFileSystemError`, `SampleBufferError`, `CircularBufferError`, `BatchError`, `QueueSizeExceededError`, `FileLockTimeoutError`, `ConnectTimeoutError`, `TimeoutError`, `BodyTimeoutError`, `HeadersTimeoutError`, `SocketError`, `CoalesceTimeoutError`) hoist their `DomainErrorArgs.build()` message builder to a `private static` class method instead of an inline arrow rebuilt on every construction call.

- 789da06: ### Fixed

  - Every `*.scenarios.json` import across the test suites carries the `with { type: 'json' }` import attribute `module: NodeNext` requires, clearing 221 `TS1543` diagnostics that `tsc -b` never surfaced because test files aren't part of any package's typechecked build — only `tsconfig.eslint.json` (used for ESLint's type-aware rules) sees them, and it consumes type information without reporting `TS` diagnostics on its own.
  - Tests that constructed a `protected`-constructor class directly with `new` now call the class's `this`-polymorphic static factory instead (`Subclass.create(...)`), clearing 78 `TS2674` diagnostics across `Clock`, `Channel`, `Coalesce`, `EntityStore`, `CircuitBreaker`, `EventBus`, `Mutex`, and `RealTimeScheduler` subclasses. The remaining 86 `TS2674` instances are left on `new` because no fitting factory exists for that call site: `StateMachine` is abstract with no static factory at all; `EffectInterpreter`, `InterpreterHistory`, `DeadLetterQueue`, `Signal`, `FetchClient`, and `ErrorClassifier`'s factories (where one exists) hardcode their own class rather than accepting `this`, so calling them on a subclass returns the base type instead of the subclass; and `Channel`/`Coalesce` subclasses that are themselves generic and expose subclass-only members lose that member's type through the factory's necessarily looser `TInstance` bound, so the direct constructor call is correct as written.

### Major Changes

- d5be000: `getRange()` returns a defensive range snapshot and sends an independently isolated snapshot to `onRangeChange`.
- d5be000: This release establishes one canonical public path across the fixed `@studnicky/*` package group. Consumers import package-owned behavior, errors, entities, and interfaces from the owning package root, construct stateful primitives through `Class.create(config)`, and invoke direct operation methods. Package code subpaths and parallel construction APIs are outside the public contract.

  Composition packages expose the ordering, failure, aggregation, or publication behavior they own. Dependency functionality stays with its declaring package and is imported directly from that package root. Collaborator accessors do not mirror scheduler, semaphore, cache, coalescer, fetch, retry, signal, timing, context, machine, or interpreter APIs. `BoundedDispatcher.getBus()` remains the functional access path for subscribing to and draining dispatcher-owned publications.

  Every JSON-Schema-expressible pure-data structure is a schema-derived type alias. Interfaces represent only runtime, callable, constructor, nominal, readonly-access, class-bearing, or other contracts that are not wholly schema-expressible. Pure data referenced by an interface is declared separately as a schema-derived named type. Declaration comments provide no exemptions, and `entitySuite` configures `@typescript-eslint/prefer-function-type` as `off` so callable interfaces receive one consistent verdict.

  Schema and validator declarations import dependency-owned symbols directly: `FromSchema` and `JSONSchema` from `json-schema-to-ts`, `ValidateFunction` from `ajv`, and `JSONSchema7Type` from `json-schema`. Each consuming package declares the dependency it uses; substrate packages do not proxy-export those declarations.

  `HookInvoker.invoke(hookName, fn)` enters synchronous hooks and returns `undefined`. `HookInvoker.invokeAsync(hookName, fn)` observes completion and returns `Promise<void>`. `onHookError(hookName, cause)` controls failure disposition without fabricating a recovery value, while hook timeout and reentrancy failures retain their package error identities.

  FSM and process orchestration use one optional `EffectHandlerInterface<TEffect, TEvent>` handler. `EffectInterpreter`, `InterpreterHistory`, and `ProcessKit` accept it through their direct `create(config)` paths. `InterpreterHistory` retains bounded, oldest-first variant-changing transition records and returns isolated readonly snapshots.

  `Signal.create()` supplies instance `compose(options)` and `timeout(ms)` lifecycle behavior; `Signal.never()` supplies the static never-aborting sentinel. `Delay.sleep(ms, { clock?, scheduler?, signal? })` and `Delay.value(...)` share the scheduler-aware cancellation path.

  `Throttle.create(config)` validates and copies caller configuration into instance-owned state. Adaptive concurrency changes only the instance's effective limit. `getStats()` returns `ThrottleStatsEntity.Type`, and `ThrottleStatsEntity.validate` is the root-exported compiled validator for trust-boundary checks.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- `VisibleRange` class: pure index/offset arithmetic computing the inclusive `[start, end]` index range of items currently visible in a virtualized list, given a scroll offset, viewport size, item-size accessor, and overscan count. Zero DOM dependency — never references `window`, `document`, or `ResizeObserver`.
- Fixed-size mode (`itemSize`) for O(1) division-based range math, and variable-size mode (`estimateSize`) for binary-searched cumulative-offset range math with `measureItem()` corrections once a real size is known.
- `onRangeChange` protected hook, overridable via subclassing, fires from `getRange()` only when the computed range differs from the previous one; `VisibleRangeError`, `VisibleRangeConfigInterface`, and `VisibleRangeEntity.Type` are public contracts.
