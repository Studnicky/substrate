## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- `Timing` builder with configurable `maxEvents` cap (LRU eviction) and `precision` options for nanosecond-resolution elapsed time output.
- `TimingEvent` builder producing structured `component.operation[.status]` event names for consistent metric keys across instrumented code.
- `TIMING_STATUS` constants covering the full lifecycle vocabulary (`start`, `complete`, `error`, `timeout`, `hit`, `miss`, `queued`, `dequeued`, `waiting`, `acquired`, `released`, `abort`).
- `NoOpTiming` implementation satisfying `TimingInterface` with zero overhead — suitable for test contexts and production code paths where timing collection is disabled.
- Protected `readHrtime()` and `onEvent()` override seams on `Timing` for deterministic testing and instrumentation without altering the public API.
