# Changelog

## 9.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 789da06: ### Changed

  - `@studnicky/logger`'s `Logger.create()`, `ConsoleTransport.create()`, `MemoryTransport.create()`, `NoOpTransport.create()`, and `FunctionTransport.create()` return the invoking subclass's own type instead of the base class. Each already constructed the subclass at runtime via `new this(...)`; the factory now types its `this` parameter and constructs through `Reflect.construct`, so `MySubclass.create(...)` types as `MySubclass` and a subclass member is readable without a cast. A runtime guard throws a `TypeError` naming the factory if construction ever yields an instance outside the requested subclass's prototype chain. Calling `Base.create(...)` directly is unaffected — it still types as `Base`.
  - `@studnicky/clock`'s `Clock.create()`, `RealTimeClockProvider.create()`, `VirtualClockProvider.create()`, and `VirtualTimeCounter.create()` follow the same subclass-return pattern.
  - `@studnicky/timing`'s `Timing.create()` and `NoOpTiming.create()` follow the same subclass-return pattern.

### Patch Changes

- 789da06: ### Fixed

  - `Clock`, `RealTimeClockProvider`, `VirtualClockProvider`, `VirtualTimeCounter`, `MemoryTransport`, `NoOpTransport`, and `NoOpTiming` each carry their class documentation on the class again. The module-local `…SubclassInterface` and `…Instance` helpers their factories rely on sat between the doc comment and the class it describes, so the generated API reference attributed each class's summary and usage example to a non-exported helper interface and left the exported class undocumented. The helpers now precede the doc comment.

- 789da06: ### Fixed

  - `logger`'s `Logger.scenarios.json` suite and `Logger.loop.spec.ts` drop the `expected.asserted: true` tautology from every case — each case's preceding behavioral assertions already prove the scenario. `LogEventName`'s `component-prefixes` case drops the redundant self-comparison of `input.components` against `expected.components` (and now also asserts `EVENT_COMPONENTS.TIMING`, the one component prefix the case previously left unchecked). `LogStatus.scenarios.json` drops the `input.values` field, which duplicated `expected.values` and was never read by the spec.
  - `circular-buffer`'s `CircularBuffer.scenarios.json` drops `shift-never-pushed-returns-undefined`, a verbatim duplicate of `shift-empty-returns-undefined`. `CircularBuffer.subclass.scenarios.json`'s `onEvict-called-with-evicted-item` now drives a longer five-push eviction chain distinct from `create-returns-subclass`, proving FIFO eviction order across three evictions instead of duplicating the same single-eviction fixture.
  - `fsm`'s `plain-error-wraps` scenario now throws a non-`Error` primitive from the reducer and asserts the resulting `ReducerThrewError`'s `cause` and the hook-observed `reason` string, exercising `StateMachine`'s `String(cause)` fallback — previously indistinguishable from `wraps-reducer-throw`, which throws a real `Error` and only exercised the `cause.message` branch.
  - `file-lock`'s `entities.scenarios.json` adds coverage for `FileLockOptionsEntity`'s previously-unexercised rejection branches: empty `path`, non-positive `pollMs`/`timeoutMs`, and an unexpected extra property under `additionalProperties: false`.
  - `timing`'s `immediate-operations` spec drops its upper-bound assertions (`durationMs < 5`, event elapsed `< 5`) taken from two back-to-back `process.hrtime()` reads with no busy-wait spacer — the fragile direction under load. It now asserts non-negativity only, matching every sibling case's lower-bound-only pattern.
  - `scheduler`'s `chained-timeout-fire` and `chained-timeout-cancel` specs no longer arm real `setTimeout` stages against a fixed wall-clock buffer. They drive `RealTimeScheduler`'s multi-stage chain deterministically via `node:test`'s `mock.timers` (mocking `Date` and `setTimeout`), ticking virtual time forward one `maxTimeoutDelayMs` stage at a time and cancelling mid-chain, eliminating the wall-clock margin entirely rather than widening it.

- 789da06: ### Fixed

  - Test-suite type errors across these packages' `tests/**` and `examples/**` are eliminated, gated on `tsc -p tsconfig.eslint.json`. Three patterns account for most of them:
    - **Un-narrowed scenario unions**: a runner map typed `Record<ScenarioCase['shape'], (c: ScenarioCase) => void>` gives every runner the full union instead of its own variant, so per-shape property access reports `TS2339`. Each runner map now types its entries `(c: Extract<ScenarioCase, { shape: K }>) => ...` via a generic `ScenarioRunner<K>`, and the dispatching `runCase`/`runnerMap[shape]` call sites are generic over the same `K`. Where one scenario variant legitimately shared its shape across multiple literal names (`Extract` distributes per union member, not per literal, so a shared-shape variant collapses to `never`), the variant is split into one member per literal instead.
    - **`this`-polymorphic factory explicit-type-argument pitfall**: `Subclass.create<T>(...)` on a `static create<T, TInstance extends Shape = Base<T>>(this: ..., ...)` factory blocks `TInstance` inference from `this`, silently returning the base type instead of the subclass and breaking every subclass-only member access. Dropping the explicit type argument (`Subclass.create(...)`) lets both parameters infer correctly. Constructors that already declared `public constructor() { super(); }` are unaffected by this and untouched.
    - **JSON-import scenario casts**: `scenarioGroups.cases` types as a JSON-literal-inferred union (widened `string` discriminants) that doesn't structurally satisfy the hand-written `ScenarioCase[]`/`Record<Shape, ...>` type without an explicit cast at the JSON→TS boundary — the same idiom already used at ~200 other call sites in this test suite.
  - A handful of one-off fixes ride along: `assert.equal(typeof x, 'y')`/`assert.ok(cond)` calls that don't narrow (replaced with explicit `if (typeof x !== 'y') throw` guards or reordered before use); array/object destructuring under strict indexed-access that needed a defined-check; a self-referential `typeof signal.addEventListener` type annotation in `resilience`; two `readonly T[]` getters typed as mutable `T[]` in `file-lock` and `cache`'s example files; a redundant no-op `.events.length = 0` on a freshly-constructed instance in `cache`'s example; and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` mismatches where an object literal explicitly carried `| undefined` into a stricter target (`bounded-dispatcher`, `retry`).
  - `packages/mutex/tests/fixtures/constants.ts` imported `MutexConfigInterface` from a path that no longer exists; it now imports `MutexConfigEntity.Type` from its current location.
  - `packages/mutex/examples/keyedWorkGateComposition.ts`'s `mutex.runExclusive(key, fn)` call (no `acceptsResult` predicate) always types its result `unknown` by design; the example now supplies the `(value): value is string => ...` predicate the source's own JSDoc documents for this case.

  ### Left as-is (verified, not a defect)

  - `ErrorClassifier` is `abstract` with no static factory at all; subclasses are constructed directly.

- 789da06: ### Fixed

  - Every `*.scenarios.json` import across the test suites carries the `with { type: 'json' }` import attribute `module: NodeNext` requires, clearing 221 `TS1543` diagnostics that `tsc -b` never surfaced because test files aren't part of any package's typechecked build — only `tsconfig.eslint.json` (used for ESLint's type-aware rules) sees them, and it consumes type information without reporting `TS` diagnostics on its own.
  - Tests that constructed a `protected`-constructor class directly with `new` now call the class's `this`-polymorphic static factory instead (`Subclass.create(...)`), clearing 78 `TS2674` diagnostics across `Clock`, `Channel`, `Coalesce`, `EntityStore`, `CircuitBreaker`, `EventBus`, `Mutex`, and `RealTimeScheduler` subclasses. The remaining 86 `TS2674` instances are left on `new` because no fitting factory exists for that call site: `StateMachine` is abstract with no static factory at all; `EffectInterpreter`, `InterpreterHistory`, `DeadLetterQueue`, `Signal`, `FetchClient`, and `ErrorClassifier`'s factories (where one exists) hardcode their own class rather than accepting `this`, so calling them on a subclass returns the base type instead of the subclass; and `Channel`/`Coalesce` subclasses that are themselves generic and expose subclass-only members lose that member's type through the factory's necessarily looser `TInstance` bound, so the direct constructor call is correct as written.

## 9.0.0

### Major Changes

- d5be000: `Timing.create(options?)` and `NoOpTiming.create()` are the only public construction paths for timing trackers. `TimingEvent.create(config)` creates frozen event data in one step from required `component` and `operation` fields plus optional `status`. Time units and timing statuses are exported as `TimeUnitEntity.Type` and `TimingStatusEntity.Type`; event and runtime contracts are interfaces. `@studnicky/timing` is the sole public code entrypoint and exports `TimingInterface`.
- d5be000: This release establishes one canonical public path across the fixed `@studnicky/*` package group. Consumers import package-owned behavior, errors, entities, and interfaces from the owning package root, construct stateful primitives through `Class.create(config)`, and invoke direct operation methods. Package code subpaths and parallel construction APIs are outside the public contract.

  Composition packages expose the ordering, failure, aggregation, or publication behavior they own. Dependency functionality stays with its declaring package and is imported directly from that package root. Collaborator accessors do not mirror scheduler, semaphore, cache, coalescer, fetch, retry, signal, timing, context, machine, or interpreter APIs. `BoundedDispatcher.getBus()` remains the functional access path for subscribing to and draining dispatcher-owned publications.

  Every JSON-Schema-expressible pure-data structure is a schema-derived type alias. Interfaces represent only runtime, callable, constructor, nominal, readonly-access, class-bearing, or other contracts that are not wholly schema-expressible. Pure data referenced by an interface is declared separately as a schema-derived named type. Declaration comments provide no exemptions, and `entitySuite` configures `@typescript-eslint/prefer-function-type` as `off` so callable interfaces receive one consistent verdict.

  Schema and validator declarations import dependency-owned symbols directly: `FromSchema` and `JSONSchema` from `json-schema-to-ts`, `ValidateFunction` from `ajv`, and `JSONSchema7Type` from `json-schema`. Each consuming package declares the dependency it uses; substrate packages do not proxy-export those declarations.

  `HookInvoker.invoke(hookName, fn)` enters synchronous hooks and returns `undefined`. `HookInvoker.invokeAsync(hookName, fn)` observes completion and returns `Promise<void>`. `onHookError(hookName, cause)` controls failure disposition without fabricating a recovery value, while hook timeout and reentrancy failures retain their package error identities.

  FSM and process orchestration use one optional `EffectHandlerInterface<TEffect, TEvent>` handler. `EffectInterpreter`, `InterpreterHistory`, and `ProcessKit` accept it through their direct `create(config)` paths. `InterpreterHistory` retains bounded, oldest-first variant-changing transition records and returns isolated readonly snapshots.

  `Signal.create()` supplies instance `compose(options)` and `timeout(ms)` lifecycle behavior; `Signal.never()` supplies the static never-aborting sentinel. `Delay.sleep(ms, { clock?, scheduler?, signal? })` and `Delay.value(...)` share the scheduler-aware cancellation path.

  `Throttle.create(config)` validates and copies caller configuration into instance-owned state. Adaptive concurrency changes only the instance's effective limit. `getStats()` returns `ThrottleStatsEntity.Type`, and `ThrottleStatsEntity.validate` is the root-exported compiled validator for trust-boundary checks.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- `Timing` tracker with configurable `maxEvents` cap (LRU eviction) and `precision` options for nanosecond-resolution elapsed time output.
- `TimingEvent` factory producing structured `component.operation[.status]` event names for consistent metric keys across instrumented code.
- `TIMING_STATUS` constants covering the full lifecycle vocabulary (`start`, `complete`, `error`, `timeout`, `hit`, `miss`, `queued`, `dequeued`, `waiting`, `acquired`, `released`, `abort`).
- `NoOpTiming` implementation satisfying `TimingInterface` with zero overhead — suitable for test contexts and production code paths where timing collection is disabled.
- Protected `readHrtime()` and `onEvent()` override seams on `Timing` for deterministic testing and instrumentation without altering the public API.
