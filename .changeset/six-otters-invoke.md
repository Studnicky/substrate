`@studnicky/errors` exports `HookInvoker`, a composable delegate for safely invoking consumer-supplied lifecycle hooks — synchronous or asynchronous, without forcing async contagion on a synchronous caller and without letting a broken hook produce an unhandled rejection. A class composes it as a field (never extends it directly) and calls `invoke(hookName, fn)` from its own methods; a caller needing a different failure disposition than the default throw defines a small delegate subclass overriding `onHookError`. Also exports `HookInvocationError`, `HookTimeoutError` (thrown when an optional `timeoutMs` elapses before a hook settles), and `ReentrantHookInvocationError` (thrown when `detectReentrancy` catches a synchronous same-call-stack reentrant `invoke`).

`@studnicky/entity-store`, `@studnicky/file-lock`, `@studnicky/health-registry`, and `@studnicky/worker-pool` route their lifecycle hooks through a record-and-continue `HookInvoker` delegate: a throwing hook override no longer aborts or corrupts an in-flight operation — the failure is recorded instead, inspectable via `hookErrorCount`/`getHookErrors()` (`getHookErrorCount()`/`getHookErrors()` on `WorkerPool`).

`@studnicky/logger`'s `Logger` composes a plain `HookInvoker` for `onLog`/`onDropped`/`onChildCreate` (unchanged throwing behavior) and separately guards `onTransportError`, recording its failures via `hookErrorCount`/`getHookErrors()` so a broken override can't abort fan-out to the remaining transports.

`@studnicky/retry` and `@studnicky/pipeline` gain a `hookTimeoutMs` builder option (and matching `Retry.create`/`Pipeline.create` config field) bounding how long an async lifecycle hook may run before it's routed to `onHookError` with a `HookTimeoutError` cause. Left unset, a hook may take arbitrarily long, matching prior behavior.
